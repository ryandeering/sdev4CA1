## Employee Management System

Made using Bootstrap, BCrypt (for password hashing) and Play Framework 2.6 for a college project.

Uses one to many (Employee - Department), many to many (Employee - Project), one to one (Employee - Address) relationships JPA style.

All programming and design: credit to me.
